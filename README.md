# backrub example scripts

This repository contains example scripts using backrub to automate backups of (mainly) user data on Linux systems.
This example assumes backing up to a directory mounted via CIFS/SMB (e.g. having a local NAS in your network).

These scripts are based on what I use to back up my personal systems and serve as a template for others, as well
as an offsite backup for me. Feel free to adapt them to your needs.

Note: these scripts assume the existence of a compiled copy of the backrub program in the local directory and attempt
to mount your CIFS share to ./mountpoint
